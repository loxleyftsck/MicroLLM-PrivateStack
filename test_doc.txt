MicroLLM-PrivateStack is a specialized AI solution designed for high-security environments.
Key features include:
1. Optimized for low-resource hardware (runs on 2GB RAM).
2. Struct-of-Arrays (SoA) semantic caching for 3.5x faster responses.
3. Full on-premise data residency (no data leaves the local network).
4. Integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for document analysis.
5. Strict security guardrails including prompt injection detection and PII masking.

The project was developed in 2026 to address the need for private, offline AI assistants in corporate settings.
